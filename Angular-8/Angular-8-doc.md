# Template syntax

## Interpolation and Template Expressions
 - Interpolation allows you to incorporate calculated strings into the text between HTML element tags and within attribute assignments
   - In the following snippet, {{ currentCustomer }} is an example of interpolation.
 - Template expressions are what you use to calculate those strings.
   - template expression appears in quotes to the right of the = symbol as in [property]="expression"
