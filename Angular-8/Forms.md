# [Forms](https://angular.io/guide/forms-overview)
 - Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms: 
 - <b>reactive</b> and <b>template-driven</b>.
 - Both capture user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update, and      provide a way to track changes.

### [Reactive forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) : 
 - Reactive forms are more robust: they're more scalable, reusable, and testable.
 - If forms are a key part of your application, or you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use reactive forms.
### [Template-driven](https://angular.io/guide/forms) 
 - Template-driven forms are useful for adding a simple form to an app, such as an email list signup form. 
 - They're easy to add to an app, but they don't scale as well as reactive forms. 
 - If you have very basic form requirements and logic that can be managed solely in the template, use template-driven forms.
